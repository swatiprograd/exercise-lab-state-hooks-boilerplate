### Learning Goals:
The aim of this exercise is to practice and understand the concept of `state's` using `functional-component`.
For this exercise, we will be using 2 `hooks` - 

1. useState()
2. useEffect()

And by using the above two hooks, we will try to achieve the same functionalities that we achieved using `component life cycle exercise` and `state management using class-component exercise`. 

### Steps to follow:

1. Clone this repository.

2. On your terminal go inside `exercise-lab-state-hooks-boilerplate` directory and use the following command: `npm install`.This command install's all the packages to your system that this project is using.
Here is a link to get a better understanding of what and how exactly the above command works.

3. Once everything is ready, you can type `npm start` -> inorder to run the application. You should be able to see a server running and see the output as shown below:
